 REV 2_4
 2016-3-31
 cc modify change baudrate function, in dealwith data routine, set a flag and response the command, then switch baudrate outside, so T3000 know if tstat accept this command
 cc fix a bug that fan auto table can not be changed.

 2016-3-17 cc 
 ---modify baudrate keypad select, after change the baudrate by keypad, system dose not restart.
 ---modify bacnet library rev2 

 REV 2_3
 2016-03-11 cc ---modify dealwithTag, make it logger, so do not response serial command too fast, otherwise minipannel will receive wrong values
 							---when initial tstat8 name, write all 20 charactors


 REV 2_2
